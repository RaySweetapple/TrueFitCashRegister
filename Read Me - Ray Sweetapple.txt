Assumptions:
- If there is no change to be returned to the user, indicate that there is 'No Change' in the result file. Otherwise, if it returned a blank line or 0, it may not be clear to the user that the result was not an error.
- If there is an error or something unexpected in the data, the exported file will indicate for that line item.
- Since this is a cash register, it is assumed that a negative value for change is invalid and there is a problem.
- I choose to only accept txt files
- Denominations for US State Currency are dollars, quarters, nickels, and pennies. I based this on the examples. Other denominations can be added or removed. 

Notes:
- I built this as a web application, though it could be easily be changed to a console application, etc.
- I choose MVC as I am most familiar with C# implementation of the pattern. I made the html form simple for now but could be modified to be more dynamic. For example, adding a indicator while processing.
- Normally, I would set the structure of the solution to use the same patterns and naming conventions used by the rest of the ecosystem. 


What might happen if the client needs to change the random divisor?
- I have the default Divisor set in the appsettings file. We could easily change the value there or add it as an option in the html form.

What might happen if the client needs to add another special case (like the random twist)?
- We could possibly add another class in TrueFit.Utilities.CurrencyTransformations that inheritsAbstractDecimalToCurrency and IDecimalToCurrency to handle the use case. 

What might happen if sales closes a new client in France?
- We can set another TrueFit.Utilities.CurrencyDenominationData class for France that inherits the abstract class AbstractCurrencyDenomination and ICurrencyDenomination that would set the denominations to use and their values. This then could be selected in the form or if needed in the appsettings. Right now I have it forced to UnitedStatesCurrencyDenominations.
